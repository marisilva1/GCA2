# GCA2

In this branch, I added extra pictures from the CalTech file, and I also played with the number of iterations after adding the images. 
I attempted also to use smaller batch sizes by choosing random batches and also iterating through each "epoch" by batch, but I encountered errors with the indexing of the array.
